Functioning Web Application with data persistence.

Hosted at: https://radiant-brushlands-29552.herokuapp.com/

Functionality: Going to the homepage takes you to an editable ToDoList which can save new tasks and delete completed tasks.

Adding an argument at the end of the url allows you to create a custom ToDo list. e.g. Navigating to https://radiant-brushlands-29552.herokuapp.com/anexample would create a ToDo list entitled "Anexample" at that url and save it; allowing you to revisit and use the custom list at a later date.
